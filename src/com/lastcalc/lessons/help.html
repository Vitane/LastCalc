      <h2>What is LastCalc?</h2>
      <img style="float: right;" src="/images/homework-cartoon.gif"
        height="100px" width="100px" /> LastCalc is a powerful but easy
      to use web-based calculator. Think of the lastCalc page like a
      notepad for calculations, you start on the top line and work your
      way down. The good news is that, unlike with a notepad and pencil,
      LastCalc does the hard work of figuring out the answers for you!

      <h2>Simple math</h2>
      LastCalc lets you do basic math, note that <b>*</b> means multiply
      and <b>/</b> means divide, for example:
      <div class="question">18/2+4*2</div>
      You type the part of the question before the
      <div class="equals">=</div>
      , and when you hit return the answer will appear after it.
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">
      <h2>Brackets</h2>
      LastCalc will multiply and divide numbers before it adds or
      subtracts them, but you can force it to calculate part of an
      answer first by putting it in brackets:<br />
      <div class="question">18/(2+4)* 2</div>
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">
      <h2>Conversions</h2>
      LastCalc understands lots of ways to measure things, weights,
      distances, durations, currencies, and so on. LastCalc will let you
      convert between different units, some examples:
      <div class="question">3 weeks in days</div>
      <div class="question">15 km in miles</div>
      Or even currency conversions (using up-to-date conversion rates):
      <div class="question">$23 in euros</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h1>Variables and Functions</h1>
    <div class="lesson">
      <h2>Assigning a result to a variable</h2>
      What if you would like to use the result of one calculation in a
      later calculation? LastCalc let's you do this:
      <div class="question">homeValue = $80000 + 10%</div>
      Note how "homeValue" is now colored to indicate that it is a
      "variable". This means that wherever LastCalc sees "homeValue", it
      will replace it with the outcome of this calculation. So now, we
      can calculate:
      <div class="question">homeValue + $2000</div>
      You can define as many variables as you like!
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">
      <h2>Functions</h2>
      What if you find yourself doing the same calculation over and over
      again? Wouldn't it be nice if LastCalc could learn to do that
      calculation for you? It can! Imagine that you are a fitness
      trainer and you frequently need to calculate someone's "body mass
      index", which is based on their weight and their height. For
      example, if your weight in kilograms is 90, and your height in
      meters is 1.8, your BMI is calculated as follows:
      <div class="question">90 / (1.8 * 1.8)</div>
      So how do we teach LastCalc how to do this for us? It's easy:
      <div class="question">bmi Height Weight = Weight / (Height *
        Height)</div>
      Let's take a closer look at this. Defining a function is similar
      to assigning a result to a variable, except for the <span
        class="highlighted variable white"> Height</span> and <span
        class="highlighted variable white"> Weight</span> - what are
      those?
      <p />
      We call these <b>parameters</b>, think of them as placeholders,
      into which LastCalc can slot any value (we call this "binding").
      When you are defining a function, any word beginning with a
      Capital Letter will become a parameter. So now, let's try using
      our new BMI calculator to do the same calculation we did before:
      <div class="question">bmi 1.8 90</div>
      Yay, as we would expect we got the same result as before, but now
      it is much easier to calculate someone's BMI. In this case, the <span
        class="highlighted variable white"> Height</span> parameter was
      "bound" to 1.8, and the <span class="highlighted variable white">
        Weight</span> parameter was "bound" to 90.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h1>Lists</h1>
    <div class="lesson">
      <h2>Creating a list and retrieving items</h2>
      People frequently deal with lists of things, and so LastCalc
      let's you have lists of things too, and manipulate those lists.
      Let's create a list of distances and assign them to a variable:
      <div class="question">trips = [2, 30, 200]</div>
      We can retrieve items from the list:
      <div class="question">get 2nd from trips</div>
      This does the same thing:
      <div class="question">get 1 from trips</div>
      "Huh?" I hear you say?  Why does "get 1" retrieve the second
      item from the list?  The reason is that lists are "indexed" 
      starting at 0, so to get the first item you use "get 0 from ...".
      But, if you use 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc then it takes care of this for 
      you.
      <p/>
      You can see the trick here:
      <div class="question">3rd</div>
      Clever eh?  3rd becomes 2 because that is what will get us the 3rd
      item in the list.  I hope that's not too confusing.
    </div>
    <div class="lesson">
      <h2>Math with lists</h2>
      Getting things from lists isn't too exciting, but you can do
      math with them too:
      <div class="question">sum of trips</div>
      <div class="question">size of trips</div>
      <div class="question">average of trips</div>
      And something a little more ambitious:
      <div class="question">average of [2 miles, 3000 meters, 5 km]</div>
      Neat eh?  We can use units in list calculations.
